It was a dark night outside, and the only light we had was the moon.
I was going to take a walk in the park, because it was so warm and I wanted to feel the gentle summer wind.
When I was about to arrive, I heard a strange _noise_ coming from the tree.

From darkness ermerged a terrifying monster : sharp claws, thick furr and a maw like a cage of rusty blades. The creature jumped at me as I drawed my sword. After a quick move I took the advantage on him and thrust the steel on his heart. He died in a last gasp of pain, but, from his wound came a sordid plume of smoke : green and purple ; filled with malefic forces. A form appeared in the cloud. It looked like a demon, with wings and chains ; with horns and tails. He spoke at me in this terms : "I'm Xantotol, master of the Night. This was my messenger. I give you the time to save your world. Defeat before dawn, and I will spare mankind, lose...and I will take your soul !" So I gathered my courage and went on this crazy night !

A demonic soul, this was the last thing I wanted to face right now. I grab my magic pow... It wasn't there anymore ! I lost my magic powder against evil demon soul. It's hopeless... What am I supposed to do without it???
