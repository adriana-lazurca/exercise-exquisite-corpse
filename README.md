It was a dark night outside, and the only light we had was the moon.
I was going to take a walk in the park, because it was so warm and I wanted to feel the gentle summer wind.
When I was about to arrive, I heard a strange _noise_ coming from the tree.

# The problem (Etienne)

The thing tried to attack me! Sharp teeth, big claws, small ears and hidding like a shadow ! I just had the time to dodge the _thing_ that it try to attack me one again! I don't know what I can do in order to escape the situation!
